Pizza dataset

Data in this set were collected online from different pizza places in inner Budapest and outer Budapest, which contain prices of 32cm margherita pizza and of 0.5L beverage.

There are 44 places found, 22 from inner Budapest and the other 22 from outer Budapest.

Rating scores, as well as the number of ratings, are from Google Reviews of each restaurant.

Distances (from CEU campus to the pizza restaurant) are from Google map. We took the shortest distance between the two places. 

We also added addresses of each restaurant as explanatory notes (not as a variable for analysis).
